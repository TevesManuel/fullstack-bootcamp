-How to create a project with Vite + React:

    npm create vite@latest {NAMEOFTHEPROJECT} -- --template react

-Ternary operator
    
    const result = condition ? val1 : val2

    Explanation: result is where val1 or val2 will be deposited, which val will be deposited in result depends on condition, if condition is true result=val1, otherwise result=val2.

-The property fields and the variable names in the object are the same
    const person = { name: name, age: age } === const person = { name, age }

    ` = ALT+96 [ASCII]
